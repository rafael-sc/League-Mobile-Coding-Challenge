# android-code-challenge

### Rafael da Silva Costa

This repo was made for the code challenge of the company League, it is a simple social network
client.

As there was no requirement for a login screen, authentication is being done automatically when
posts are required. As well as there was no requirement for a screen other than the list of posts I
did all the ui implementation in the MainActivity.

#### Build instructions

Just sync the gradle files and run, you may need to set the JRE path in android studio.
